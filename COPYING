I believe since the repository contains just the build files and patches,
the whole repository is ineliglible for copyright. However, since
Wyvertux does redistribute binaries, we've included Apache 2.0 license
and the MIT (Expat) copyright notice included in rustc verbatim. See
LICENSE-APACHE and LICENSE-MIT for the terms.

However, in case it is eligible for copyright. The notice below apply.
Note that the notice below doesn't apply to the patch.
