RUST-BUILD
==========

This repository contains build files and patches needed to get Rust
working in LLVM. A git tag (and a GitHub "release") will be a central
part of this repository to contain a Rust built with pure-LLVM toolchain
(in this case, Wyvertux and Wyverkiss).

NOTE:
This is built under musl-libc environment. glibc/uclibc/dietlibc may
need adjustments.
